Observation 1: The Rome Protocols were a series of three international agreements concluded in Rome on 17 March 1934 between the governments of Austria, Hungary and Italy. They were signed by Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss and Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Gömbös. All of the protocols went into effect on 12 July 1934 and were registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 12 December 1934.
Action 2: Search[Benito Mussolini]
Observation 2: Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (...) was an Italian politician (...) summary execution in 1945 by Italian partisans. (...)
Action 3: Finish[World War II]

Reflection: I searched one of the prime ministers involved in the signing then attempted to answer right away. I should have searched each of the prime ministers, then looked up 'death' or 'assassinated' on each of their pages to get more specific information before answering, or checked if all three were assassinated. The question specified only one was assassinated. I should focus on Engelbert Dollfuss or Gyula Gömbös. My final answer "World War II" was too broad. I need to verify the specific assassination event for the correct prime minister.

Question: Kam Heskin plays Paige Morgan in a 2004 film directed by who?
Action 1: Search[Kam Heskin]
Observation 1: Kam Erika Heskin (born May 8, 1973) is an American actress. She began her career playing Caitlin Deschanel on the NBC daytime soap opera Sunset Beach (1998–1999), before appearing in films Planet of the Apes (2001) and Catch Me If You Can (2002). Heskin went on in 2003 to play Elizabeth Bennet in an independent film Pride & Prejudice: A Latter-Day Comedy, Robin in Charmed (2004), and Paige Morgan in The Prince and Me film franchise (2006–2010).

Reflection: I got stuck in a loop trying to search for 'The Prince and Me (2004 film)' which repeatedly failed. The initial search for Kam Heskin mentioned she played Paige Morgan in "The Prince and Me film franchise (2006-2010)" and "Robin in Charmed (2004)". The question specifically asks about a 2004 film. I missed that "Charmed (2004)" was mentioned for Kam Heskin. I should have investigated "Charmed (2004)" or, if "The Prince and Me" was indeed a 2004 film, I should have used the similar search result 'The Prince & Me' that was offered and seems more likely to be the correct film title. I need to be more careful with dates and explore provided similar search results when direct searches fail.
